# About this project

This is my Twitter clone project, I used Tailwind CSS for the first time its a better and easier way to style elements in my opinion, I used local storage to act as a Database and store all the user information in, I made it so you can't redirect to /Home or /Profile page without logging in so you will be redirected to the Sign up page everytime, I added features like Tweeting, deleting tweets, liking and retweeting other users tweets, following users or unfollowing users, adding a profile picture or a banner picture, changing the name or adding a bio, I made sure I can keep adding more features to this project in the future to improve it which is my plan
