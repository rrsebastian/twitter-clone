# About this project

This is my Twitter clone project, I used Tailwind CSS for the first time its a better and easier way to style elements in my opinion, I used local storage to act as a Database and store all the user information in, I made it so you can't redirect to /Home or /Profile page without logging in so you will be redirected to the Sign up page everytime, I added features like Tweeting, deleting tweets, liking and retweeting other users tweets, following users or unfollowing users, adding a profile picture or a banner picture, changing the name or adding a bio, I made sure I can keep adding more features to this project and improve some of the current features to improve the overall application which is my plan. 

Here is the Design inspiration i found on Figma but I also used Twitter to Design my project - https://www.figma.com/file/o6tOVC45lELWo0KR9x0a73/Twitter-desktop-pages-(feed%2C-sigup%2C-login%2C-profile)-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=dQFow6VhJwnf8K5d-1
